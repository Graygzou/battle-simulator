# Battle-Simulation

Battle simulator made with the game engine [JMonkey](http://jmonkeyengine.org/), using a graph as model. Developed for class [*Distributed Databases* **(8INF803)**](http://cours.uqac.ca/8INF803) at [UQAC](https://uqac.ca) (QC, CA).

The [GraphX](https://spark.apache.org/graphx/) API, which is *Apache Spark's API for graphs and graph-parallel computation* is used to create the back-end graph. 

The main objective of this work was to understand graphs strength in the parallelization of tasks. We used it to compute a small turn based game with dungeon and dragons entities.

# Prerequisites
